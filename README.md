# Next.js Wordle Clone

[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a web-based word game published by the *New York Times Company*. You get six attempts to guess a five-letter target word. After each guess, the letters light up in various colors as clues. Green means a letter is correct in this spot; yellow means a letter is elsewhere in the target word; gray means a letter is not in the target word at all.
I built this because I love playing Wordle every day and it seemed like a fun project to practice application state management with Redux. I am looking forward to adding tests to this app.
